## Code Styling

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Make sure to follow the coding style to maintain consistency across the project. The configuration for Prettier is already set up in the project.


## Testing

netmovie includes a test suite to ensure code reliability. Our Tests is written in Vitest. To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
